## The Clustering of Hotels based on their proximity to Food places
### Introduction/Business Problem
As someone who regularly uses hotel services on my trips, my choice of a hotel has always been dependant mostly on the availability of places to eat food and food delivery options in the proximity of my hotel. Given, I don't always get to stay at one locality or one hotel everytime i visit a city, I can really use an analysis that clusters together the hotels of a city based on the type of food available closeby. That forms the essense of my project. 
In the project, i shall be working on a city i visit frequently, Hyderabad (India) and use Foursquare data in identifying its hotels as well as the food places that surround them to obtain the data I need. I shall then, Identify the most popular types of food that are available nearby and use that data to cluster similar hotels. I shall be using Kmeans clustering for the project.
